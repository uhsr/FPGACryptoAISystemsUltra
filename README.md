# FPGACryptoAISystemsUltra

## Description

A Rust-based cryptocurrency wallet library employing zero-knowledge proofs for shielded transactions and leveraging hardware security modules (HSMs) for enhanced key management.

## Features

- Implements a high-throughput Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) engine on the FPGA fabric, achieving a minimum throughput of 10 Gbps.
- Deploys a hardware-accelerated SHA-3 hashing algorithm with optimized resource utilization for reduced power consumption.
- Utilizes an FPGA-based physically unclonable function (PUF) for secure key generation and device authentication.
- Employs side-channel attack countermeasures, including masking and hiding techniques, to protect cryptographic operations.
- Integrates an AI-powered anomaly detection system to identify and mitigate potential security threats in real-time.
- Provides a configurable architecture supporting various cryptographic algorithms, including RSA, ECC, and post-quantum cryptography.
- Generates optimized Hardware Description Language (HDL) code from high-level synthesis (HLS) for efficient FPGA resource mapping.
- Implements a secure boot process with hardware root of trust to prevent unauthorized firmware modifications.
